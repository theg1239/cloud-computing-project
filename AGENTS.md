## Problem Details

### Project Overview
Design and implement a cloud-based platform to manage and monitor the usage, scheduling, inventory, and maintenance of laboratory facilities in an educational institution.

### Objectives
1. Provide remote access to lab schedules, equipment inventory, and experiment documentation.  
2. Enable online booking and allocation of lab resources.  
3. Automate notifications for lab maintenance, usage tracking, and consumable availability.  
4. Store and manage experiment data and lab reports on the cloud.  
5. Allow multi-user access with different roles (Admin, Faculty, Student, Technician).

### Modules / Features

#### 1) User Management
- Role-based access control (Admin, Faculty, Student, Technician)
- Login/Registration using institutional email

#### 2) Lab Scheduling & Booking
- Book lab slots for experiments
- View available labs and equipment in real time
- Prevent double bookings

#### 3) Equipment Inventory Management
- Track equipment availability and status (In Use, Under Maintenance, Available)
- Request new equipment

#### 4) Maintenance & Alerts
- Report faulty equipment
- Auto-notifications to technicians for repair
- Track repair history

#### 5) Experiment Data & Documentation
- Upload experiment results and lab reports
- Centralized cloud storage for past experiments and SOPs
- Version control of reports and files

#### 6) Analytics Dashboard
- Lab usage analytics
- Equipment usage statistics
- Student participation and experiment completion rates

### Example Scenarios
- A student books a lab for a project and uploads the report after completion.  
- A technician receives alerts for lab maintenance tasks.  
- Faculty checks lab availability and reserves it for a class experiment.  
- Admin monitors lab usage statistics and plans resource allocation.
